						<div class="panel-body">
							Upper Canada College Robotics is a dedicated group of students working together with the common goal of teaching robotics. Whether it be through the <a href="vex_about.php">VEX Competition</a>,
							<a href="horizons_about.php">Horizons Robotics</a>, or <a href="projects_arduino.php">our</a> <a href="projects_keyboard.php">many</a> <a href="projects_soldering.php">projects</a>, our club teaches students
							core Computer Science, Engineering, and Robotics skills.
							</br>
							</br>
							Our club meets everyday afterschool, in room CL2. Members can come in whenever they want, though we suggest that members come in at least once a week. <a href="horizons_schedule.php">Horizons Robotics</a> is held on Thursdays in room CC3 during the winter,
							with no robotics being held in room CL2. <a href="vex_schedule.php">VEX Competitions</a> happen thoughout the year on Saturdays.

									UCC Robotics provides students a foundation for engineering, computer science, and the applied sciences.
									Building upon what is taught in the school curriculum, club members learn in the fields of math, physics, chemistry, and computer science, as well as skillsets including creating and presenting ideas, documentation and reports, and teamwork skills. We offer an extensive education program, through lessons, mentoring, club workshops, and competitions. Our education program goes beyond simply robotics: basic engineering skills such as soldering, and introductory computer science are a cornerstone of our club. Club members become immersed into the worlds of computer science, engineering, and robotics; and with that, all of the invaluable skills that go along with it.
									</br>
									</br>
									Furthermore, our club provides students with the experience of mentorship and leadership. The club is entirely student-run, which requires members to step up and take leadership roles. Our club teaches students how to manage projects, students, and responsibilities of an orgnaisation. Through these ideals, robotics club members aren't only well-versed in the world of robotics; they also become strong leaders in the process.

									Our Robotics Club isn't just vehicle for kids to learn; robotics club is a community. Club members work with each other, mentor each other, and create long-lasting friendships. We emphasize learning how to work as a cohesive team, a skill that presents itself many times in careers througout the world. This includes skills such as communication, leadership, and organisation. Furthermore, we encourage members to mentor each other. Every single member has something to bring to the table; we just want students to share it. Our club also features a strong community. Our club heads, club alumni, as well as our faculty advisors, present a multitude of opportunities to further enrich each student's learning experiences, especially when looking forward to University. We have graduates at Carnegie-Mellon University, Waterloo Mechatronics, and UofT Engineering. Ultimately, our robotics club allows students to join and support a community that has much to offer.
									</br>
									</br>
									Upper Canada College Robotics isn't just a community: we strive to foster one. Through UCC'S Horizons program, we bring robotics to hundreds of under-privileged kids in Toronto. Not only do students gain the valuable experience of learning to teach, we give back to the community. We understand the joys and benefits of robotics. Why not spread them around?

									Robotics and Computer Science are some of the most innovative and sought-after careers, simply due to the ever-changing needs of companies, institutions, and society. UCC Robotics provides this experience to our
									club members, through three core fundamentals that are carried on to their professional lives. Firstly, our club encourages creative problem solving. Through the <a href="vex_about.php">VEX competition</a>,
									we provide students with a problem to solve (scoring points), restrictions (regulations as well as money and time), and a planning methodology (prototyping, testing, and bug fixing). Through in-house Computer Science
									problems and tasks, we force members to utilise their brain's creative side to jump over numerous logical hurdles.
									These skills not only help club members with creating awesome robots now, but gives them valuable problem solving skills for future careers.
									</br>
									</br>
									Secondly, our club gives students opportunities to adapt to new technology.
									Through projects such as our <a href="projects_arduino.php">Arduino sessions</a>, we give our members the ability to learn about innovative technologies, how to use them, and how to apply them in the real world.
									In the future, club members will be better suited to use this type of technology, as well as learning how to quickly integrate new technology into their current workflow.
									</br>
									</br>
									Finally, we teach students valuable work management, organisation, and leadership skills. Modelling our club's project system after <a href="https://investor.google.com/corporate/2004/ipo-founders-letter.html">Google's 20%  Time</a>, we let students run and present their own projects to the club, while still contributing to club events. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/malsf21/robotics-club-website">this very own website</a>,
									<a href="horizons_about.php">Horizons Robotics</a>, and <a href="projects_arduino.php">Arduino sessions</a>, all of which are completely student organized and student run. This gives members better understand how
									professional workflow functions: gathering materials, creating a sales pitch, organizing and managing human resources, setting goals and plans, and ultimately polishing them up for release. The use of resources such as
									<a href="http://github.com">github</a> get members accquainted with real-world code-management software, immersing them into a true work environment. Ultimately, we create the new engineers, coders, and project managers of tomorrow.
